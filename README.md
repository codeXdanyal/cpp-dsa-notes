# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

This repository is a personal collection of **notes, code examples, and insights** on **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.  
I am using it to organize everything I learn as I go through different topics, implement solutions, and understand core concepts.

The goal is to have a **single, structured place** to revisit concepts, practice coding, and reflect on my learning.  
At the same time, this repository is available for anyone who wants to **learn, revise, or explore DSA concepts** in a clear and organized way.

## Purpose

This repository is designed to:

- **Document concepts**: Keep track of all the DSA topics I study, with clear explanations and notes.
- **Provide practical examples**: Include code implementations for each concept, so theory is supported by practice.
- **Facilitate revision**: Create a structured resource that can be used for quick reference and review.
- **Share knowledge**: Allow others to follow along, learn, and benefit from organized notes.

This is an **ongoing repository**, meaning topics will be added progressively as I learn and practice new concepts.

## Topics Covered

Here is where I will link and organize the topics as I add notes and code:

| **Lecture No.** | **Topic**                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lecture 01**  | [Flowchart & Pseudocode](./01-flowchart-pseudocode/README.md) |

> [!NOTE]
> **More topics will be added as I learn and take notes.**

## How to Clone

To access this repository locally, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codeXdanyal/cpp-dsa-notes
cd cpp-dsa-notes

You can then browse the folders to view notes and code examples.
